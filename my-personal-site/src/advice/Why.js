            <p>The question everyone asks.
                Well here is the reason why advice is important.
                We dont have the answer to everything.
                Some wish we did but others believe it is essential for humans to be able to ask for help or for advice it helps us grow and helps us see things in a new light.
                I believe everyone needs a little advice, you never know when it could truly come in handy or when it may apply to something you dont realise.
                Me personally i love asking for advice or another individuals input, i have gotten some amazing advice over the years. I hope this application gives you some good advice you never know it may apply tomorrow!
